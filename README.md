# Cybersecurity-Piscine42

## 📝 Overview
The Piscine is a structured set of small projects (modules) designed to teach various **languages, paradigms, and technologies**. Each day introduces a new concept, and completing the full Piscine requires consistent work over multiple days.


## 🛠️ Included Projects
This repository contains the projects I completed during the Piscine, including but not limited to:

- [Spider & Scorpion](./arachnida/) – Recursive image downloader & EXIF metadata analyzer (Python)
- Other modules covering different languages, paradigms, and technologies learned during the Piscine.

Each project is self-contained with its own README explaining usage, requirements, and implementation details.


## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of the Piscine projects is to:
- Learn new programming languages and paradigms
- Gain practical experience with small-scale projects
- Improve problem-solving and coding skills
